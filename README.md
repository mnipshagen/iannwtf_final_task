# Implementing Artificial Neural Networks with Tensorflow - Final Task: A recipe generator
## A project by Antonia Hain, Anton Laukemper & Moritz Nipshagen

## Preface
This project was developed in the context of the course **Implementing Artificial Neural Networks with Tensorflow** taught at Osnabr√ºck University by Lukas Braun. Its goal was to test and enhance our skillset and understanding of neural networks and the tensorflow framework.

The code was developed and tested with
* python 3.6
* tensorflow 1.5
* MongoDB 3.6

## Install & Use
* MongoDB
    * Download & install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
    * The application expects a local server running at `mongodb://localhost:27017`
    * The server either needs to host a database named `iannwtf` and a collection `recipes` or the `build_db.py` (see below) script can crawl and build the database from scratch. This takes a while.
    * A backup of the database can be downloaded from [Mo's Onedrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!Am3LtCW8Ozvuh7J19osxy3B-qIucfQ) and restored with the `mongorestore` application bundled with the MongoDB server installation. The syntax is `mongorestore -d iannwtf <directory_backup>`. Also refer to [the documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/).

## What this is

### Data collection and pre-processing
The `build_db.py` is the crawler script to fetch the data from the chefkoch api. It expects a local hosted mongo_db database running at port 27017 with a db named `iannwtf`. It will create a collection named `recipes` and remove it if it already exists.
