# Implementing Artificial Neural Networks with Tensorflow - Final Task: A recipe generator
## A project by Antonia Hain, Anton Laukemper & Moritz Nipshagen

## Preface
This project was developed in the context of the course **Implementing Artificial Neural Networks with Tensorflow** taught at Osnabr√ºck University by Lukas Braun. Its goal was to test and enhance our skillset and understanding of neural networks and the tensorflow framework.

The code was developed and tested with
* python 3.6
* tensorflow 1.5 & 1.3
* MongoDB 3.6
* Firebase 03/2018

## An overview
* MongoDB
    * Download & install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
    * The application expects a local server running at `mongodb://localhost:27017`
    * The server either needs to host a database named `iannwtf` and a collection `recipes` or the `build_db.py` (see below) script can crawl and build the database from scratch. This takes a while.
    * A backup of the database can be downloaded from [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AvTNk9gMBgjaegEexxiqTOTx1gs) and restored with the `mongorestore` application bundled with the MongoDB server installation. The syntax is `mongorestore -d iannwtf <directory_backup>` or `mongorestore ./` if the iannwtf folder is in the working directory. Also refer to [the documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/).
* The Jupyter-Notebook file holds the actual network code.
* The backup is already processed, but if the database is created from scratch, the `remap_food_ids` function from the `process.py` script must be called beforehand.
